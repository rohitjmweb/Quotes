  <p >In the Beginner's Mind, there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are but few.<br>
  ~ Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind Beginner's Mind
  </p>
  <br>


  <p >If you have more than one reason to do something (choose a doctor or a veternarian, hire a gardener or an employee, 
  marry a person, go on a trip), just don't do it. It doesn't mean that one reason is better than two, just that by invoking more tham one reason you
  are trying to convince yourself to do something. Obvious decisions (robust to error) require no more than a single reason.<br>
  ~ Nassim Nicholas Taleb

<p>Don't tell me it is impossible, tell me you can't do it. Tell me it's never been done. The only things we really know are Maxwell's equations, 
the three laws of Newton, the two postulates of relativity, and the periodic table. That's all we know that's true. All the rest are man's laws. <br>
~ Dean Kamen(Segway)

 <p >A man who mistakes secrets for knowledge is like a man who, seeking light, hugs a candle so closely that he smothers it and burns his hand.<br>
