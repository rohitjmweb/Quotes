  <p > When there's speech that is completely forbidden, and questions that are not allowed to be asked, normally,
  you should assume those things are simply true.<br>
 ~ Peter Theil.
 </p>
 <br>

  ~ Aristotle.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p >Provability is a weaker notion than the truth.<br>
   ~ Douglas Hofstatder, GEB.
   </p>
   <br>


  <p >To give your cow or sheep a large space in a meadow is to control it.<br>

  ~ Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind Beginner's Mind.
  </p>
  <br>


  <p >If you have more than one reason to do something (choose a doctor or a veternarian, hire a gardener or an employee, 
  marry a person, go on a trip), just don't do it. It doesn't mean that one reason is better than two, just that by invoking more tham one reason you
  are trying to convince yourself to do something. Obvious decisions (robust to error) require no more than a single reason.<br>
  ~ Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
  </p>
  <br>


  <p >Morality and Ethics automatically emerge when we realize the long term consequences of our actions.<br>

 <p >There are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, other is getting it.<br>
 ~ Oscar Wilde.
 </p>
 <br>
      
<p >I don't know if you're special. Only you gonna know that when the time is right.
      It ain't gonna come overnight. You're gonna take a beating. You are gonna take this..<br> You're gonna get 
      knocked down, you're gonna get up.. and you're gonna see if you got the right thing. But, you gotta work hard.
      I swear to God. If you're not gonna do it, I'm out.<br>
      ~ Rocky Balboa, Creed

<p >Do you want to live forever, Harry?"<br>

      "Yes, and so do you," said Harry. "I want to live one more day. Tomorrow I will still want to live one more day. 
      Therefore I want to live forever, proof by induction on the positive integers. If you don't want to die, it 
      means you want to live forever. If you don't want to live forever, it means you want to die.<br>
      What would you do with eternity, Harry?"<br>
      Harry took a deep breath. "Meet all the interesting people in the world, read all the good books and then write 
      something even better, celebrate my first grandchild's tenth birthday party on the Moon, celebrate my first 
      great-great-great grandchild's hundredth birthday party around the Rings of Saturn, learn the deepest and final 
      rules of Nature, understand the nature of consciousness, find out why anything exists in the first place, visit 
      other stars, discover aliens, create aliens, rendezvous with everyone for a party on the other side of the Milky Way 
      once we've explored the whole thing, meet up with everyone else who was born on Old Earth to watch the Sun finally go 
      out, and I used to worry about finding a way to escape this universe before it ran out of negentropy but I'm a lot more 
      hopeful now that I've discovered the so-called laws of physics are just optional guidelines. <br>
      Life is not a finite list of things that you check off before you're allowed to die," Harry said firmly. 
      "It's life, you just go on living it. If I'm not doing those things it'll be because I've found something better."<br>
      ~ Eliezer Yudkowsky, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.
      </p>
      <br>

<p >Grant to us the serenity of mind to accept that which cannot be changed,courage to change that which can be 
      changed,and wisdom to know the one from the other. <br>
      ~ Karl Paul Reinhold Niebuhr
 </p>
 <br>
      

<p >Here's to the crazy ones. The rebels. The misfits. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They are not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them. Disagree with them. Glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you cant do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. For some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

<p >The fight is won or lost far away from the witnesses- behind the lines, in the gym, and out there on the road. Long before I dance under those lights. <br>

</p>
<br>

<p >If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable. <br>
~ Seneca the Younger
</p>

 <p >A flower falls even though we love it. A weed grows even though we dont love it. <br>
