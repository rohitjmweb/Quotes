<p >I don't know if you're special. Only you gonna know that when the time is right.
      It ain't gonna come overnight. You're gonna take a beating. You are gonna take this..<br> You're gonna get 
      knocked down, you're gonna get up.. and you're gonna see if you got the right thing. But, you gotta work hard.
      I swear to God. If you're not gonna do it, I'm out.<br>
      ~ Rocky Balboa, Creed

<p >Do you want to live forever, Harry?"<br>

      "Yes, and so do you," said Harry. "I want to live one more day. Tomorrow I will still want to live one more day. 
      Therefore I want to live forever, proof by induction on the positive integers. If you don't want to die, it 
      means you want to live forever. If you don't want to live forever, it means you want to die.<br>
      What would you do with eternity, Harry?"<br>
      Harry took a deep breath. "Meet all the interesting people in the world, read all the good books and then write 
      something even better, celebrate my first grandchild's tenth birthday party on the Moon, celebrate my first 
      great-great-great grandchild's hundredth birthday party around the Rings of Saturn, learn the deepest and final 
      rules of Nature, understand the nature of consciousness, find out why anything exists in the first place, visit 
      other stars, discover aliens, create aliens, rendezvous with everyone for a party on the other side of the Milky Way 
      once we've explored the whole thing, meet up with everyone else who was born on Old Earth to watch the Sun finally go 
      out, and I used to worry about finding a way to escape this universe before it ran out of negentropy but I'm a lot more 
      hopeful now that I've discovered the so-called laws of physics are just optional guidelines. <br>
      Life is not a finite list of things that you check off before you're allowed to die," Harry said firmly. 
      "It's life, you just go on living it. If I'm not doing those things it'll be because I've found something better."<br>
      ~ Eliezer Yudkowsky, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.

<p>I have two basic rules about winning in trading as well as in life:<br>1. If you don't bet, you can't win. 2. If you lose all your chips, you can't bet.<br>

<p> Your boos mean nothing. I have seen what makes you cheer.<br>

<p>When action grows unprofitable, gather information; when information grows unprofitable, sleep.<br>
