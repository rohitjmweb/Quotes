<p >I have a theory, which has not let me down so far, that there is an inverse relationship between imagination and money. 
Because the more money and technology that is available to create a work, the less imagination there will be in it.<br>
 ~ Alan Moore.

 <p >There are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, other is getting it.<br>
 ~ Oscar Wilde.

 <p >Have you ever tried multiplying roman numerals? It’s incredibly, ridiculously difficult. That’s why, before the 14th century, 
everyone thought that multiplication was an incredibly difficult concept, and only for the mathematical elite.<br>
Then Arabic numerals came along, with their nice place values, and we discovered that even seven-year-olds can handle 
multiplication just fine. There was nothing difficult about the concept of multiplication — the problem was that numbers, 
at the time, had a bad user interface.

 <p >The best way for doubters to control a questionable new technology is to embrace it, lest it remain wholly in the 
hands of enthusiasts who think there is nothing questionable about it.<br>
 ~ Stewart Brand.
