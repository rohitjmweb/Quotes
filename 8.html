<p >When I was 10 years old, pop said to me, "Son, it's a truly lucky man who knows what he wants to do in this world 
'cause that man will never work a day in his life."<br>
But there are a few, a precious few, and hell, I don't know if they're lucky or not, but there are a few people who 
find something they have to do. Something obsesses them. Something that if they can't do it, it's going to drive them 
clean out of their mind.<br>
I'm that guy. And I know one other man feels exactly the same. His name? His name is Mr. Henry Ford. And together, 
we're going to build the fastest automobile in the world. And we're gonna make history too, at Le Mans.<br> 
~ Carol Shelby, Ford vs Ferrari.

<p >The fight is won or lost far away from the witnesses- behind the lines, in the gym, and out there on the road. Long before I dance under those lights. <br>

<p >If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable. <br>

 <p >A flower falls even though we love it. A weed grows even though we dont love it. <br>

 <p > Look, as sentient meat, however illusory our identities are, we craft those identities 
    by making value judgments: everybody judges, all the time. Now, you got a problem with that... You're livin' wrong.
<br>
~ Rust Cohle, True Detective.
